She decided to use it as a metaphor for her own life and relationships.
 
The song is a challenge to herself and to her listeners to question their own feelings and commitment. She sings: "Is your love big enough for what's coming? / Is your love big enough for what's coming? / Is your love big enough for what's coming? / Is your love big enough?"
