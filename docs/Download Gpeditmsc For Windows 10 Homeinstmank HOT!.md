## What is gpedit.msc?
 
Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that lets you manage Windows settings stored in the registry. You can use gpedit.msc to control how your PC or a group of PCs behaves, by enabling or disabling certain features, setting security policies, customizing user interface, and more. Gpedit.msc is mainly intended for network administrators, but it can also be useful for power users who want to tweak their Windows system.
 
## Why is gpedit.msc not available on Windows 10 Home?
 
Microsoft does not include gpedit.msc on Windows 10 Home edition because it considers it an advanced feature that most home users do not need. Moreover, some of the settings that gpedit.msc can change may affect the stability or performance of your PC if not used properly. Therefore, Microsoft wants to limit the access to gpedit.msc to professional or enterprise users who have more technical knowledge and experience.
