# What is Epri Tr 100622 and How Does It Help with Substation Grounding?
 
Epri Tr 100622 is a software package that consists of four computer programs: SOMIP, SMECC, SGSYS, and TGRND. These programs are designed to help engineers analyze and design substation grounding systems to meet safety standards and reduce the risk of electric shock[^1^] [^2^].
 
Substation grounding systems are essential for ensuring the proper operation and protection of electrical equipment and personnel in substations. A substation grounding system consists of a network of conductors buried in the soil that connect the substation equipment to the earth. The main functions of a substation grounding system are to provide a low resistance path for fault currents to flow to the earth, to limit the ground potential rise (GPR) during faults, and to minimize the step and touch voltages that can endanger people and animals in the vicinity of the substation[^1^] [^2^].

Epri Tr 100622 software package provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing and designing substation grounding systems. The four programs have different capabilities and purposes:
 
- SOMIP (SOil Measurement Interpretation Program) computes the best estimate of the parameters of a two-layer soil model from soil resistivity measurements. It also provides error bounds on the soil parameters for a given confidence level[^1^].
- SMECC (Substation Mesh Equivalent Circuit Computation) computes the equivalent circuit parameters of a substation grounding system from its geometry and soil parameters. It also computes the self and mutual impedances of all conductors in the system[^2^].
- SGSYS (Substation Grounding SYStem Analysis Program) analyzes the substation ground field given the total electric current injected into the ground field and the design of the grounding system. It computes various outputs such as total ground resistance, step voltage, touch voltage, transfer voltages, ground potential rise, body currents, and voltage profiles along straight lines[^2^].
- TGRND (Transient GrouND Analysis Program) analyzes the transient response of a grounding system to lightning or switching surges. It computes the transient ground potential rise and ground system impedance as functions of time and frequency[^2^].

Epri Tr 100622 software package can be used in an interactive or batch mode. In the interactive mode, the user defines the grounding system geometry, soil parameters, and output requests interactively, with the use of a user-friendly graphical interface. In the batch mode, the user prepares an input file with all the necessary data and runs the program without any interaction[^1^] [^2^].
 
Epri Tr 100622 software package can help engineers design safe and effective substation grounding systems by providing accurate and reliable analysis results. The software can also help engineers evaluate different design alternatives and optimize the performance and cost of substation grounding systems[^3^].
