Some of the features of IDRISI Selva 11 include:
 
- A complete GIS analysis package for basic and advanced spatial analysis, including tools for surface and statistical analysis, decision support, and change and time series analysis.
- A complete image processing system with the most extensive hard and soft classifiers in the industry, including machine learning classifiers such as neural networks and classification tree analysis, as well as image segmentation for classification.
- Integrated modeling environments such as the Earth Trends Modeler for image time series of environmental trends and Land Change Modeler for land change analysis and prediction, a critical component for REDD projects.
- Complete utilities for import and export along with a comprehensive set of documentation and tutorials.

IDRISI Selva 11 can help you with various spatial applications such as environmental monitoring, natural resource management, urban planning, disaster management, land use change modeling, climate change analysis, biodiversity conservation, and more. Whether you are a beginner or an expert in GIS and image processing, IDRISI Selva 11 can provide you with the tools you need to explore, analyze, and visualize spatial data.
 
If you want to learn more about IDRISI Selva 11, you can visit the Clark Labs website[^1^] or watch this video tutorial[^3^]. You can also request a demo or download a free trial version of the software from their website.
  
One of the advantages of IDRISI Selva 11 is that it is compatible with various data formats and sources, such as raster and vector data, satellite imagery, aerial photography, GPS data, and web services. You can easily import and export data from and to other software platforms, such as ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth, and Microsoft Excel. You can also access online data sources such as Landsat, MODIS, SRTM, and WorldClim from within IDRISI Selva 11.
 
Another advantage of IDRISI Selva 11 is that it has a user-friendly interface that allows you to perform complex spatial operations with ease. You can use the graphical user interface (GUI) to access the modules and tools, or you can use the command line interface (CLI) to write scripts and batch processes. You can also customize the interface by creating your own toolbars, menus, and shortcuts. IDRISI Selva 11 also provides a help system that contains detailed descriptions of all the modules and tools, as well as examples and references.
