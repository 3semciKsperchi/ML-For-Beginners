Bonjour is a technology developed by Apple that enables automatic discovery of devices and services on a local network using industry standard IP protocols. It is useful for applications that need to communicate with other devices or services without manual configuration, such as iTunes, Safari, AirPlay, and more.

However, if you download and install Bonjour from Apple's website, you will also get Bonjour Print Services, which is a program that allows you to print to any Bonjour-enabled printer from your Windows computer. This may not be necessary or desirable for some users who do not have or use such printers.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to install only the Bonjour Service without the Bonjour Print Services on Windows. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Download the Bonjour Print Services for Windows installer from [Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US).
2. Extract the installer file using WinRAR or 7ZIP. You should see two files: Bonjour.msi and Bonjour64.msi. The latter is for 64-bit systems, while the former is for 32-bit systems.
3. Double-click on the appropriate file for your system and follow the on-screen prompts to install it. This will install only the Bonjour Service without the Bonjour Print Services.
4. If you want to verify that the installation was successful, you can open the Services app from the Start menu and look for the Bonjour Service in the list. It should be running and set to start automatically.

That's it! You have successfully installed the Bonjour Service without the Bonjour Print Services on Windows. You can now enjoy the benefits of Bonjour-enabled applications without having to deal with unnecessary printing software.
