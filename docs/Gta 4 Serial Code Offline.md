# How to Activate GTA 4 Offline with Serial Code
 
If you have bought GTA 4 for PC and want to play it without an internet connection, you will need to activate it offline with a serial code. This is a mandatory process for all installations of GTA 4 PC, regardless of format. In this article, we will show you how to do it in three simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Collect your Product Code and Unlock Requestcode
 
The first thing you need to do is to collect your Product Code (serial number) and your Unlock Requestcode. The Product Code can be found on the back of your game manual, or in a billing email if you bought the game online. It will be in the following format: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX.

The Unlock Requestcode will be displayed during installation of the game, or by running the game again after installation is complete, when no internet connection is detected and you choose to "Activate manually". It will look something like this:

## Step 2: Generate an Unlock Code and download the Offline Installer
 
The next thing you need to do is to generate an Unlock Code and download the GTAIVPC\_OfflineInstaller.zip file on another PC with internet access and no firewall restrictions. To do this, you will need to visit this website: https://support.securom.com/rockstarunlock/GTA\_IV/index.php?c=offline and enter your Product Code and Unlock Requestcode in the fields provided. Then click on "Generate Unlock Code".
 
You will see a confirmation message with your Unlock Code and a link to download the GTAIVPC\_OfflineInstaller.zip file. The Unlock Code will be in the following format: VCUJR-6N3YN-FQ9S4-SCSA6-ULH7E-F2G2G-PLJ55-KDSG9-NQF3. The GTAIVPC\_OfflineInstaller.zip file is approximately 10 MB in size, so make sure you have enough room on your storage device for it.
 
Copy both your Unlock Code and the GTAIVPC\_OfflineInstaller.zip file onto a USB drive, a writeable disc, or some other portable storage device that you can take back to the computer where the game was installed.
 
## Step 3: Activate the game with your Unlock Code and Offline Installer
 
The final thing you need to do is to activate the game with your Unlock Code and Offline Installer on the computer where the game was installed. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Close your internet connection. (This must be done so unplug the cord or disable your wireless connection.)
2. Move the paul.dll file from the GTAIVPC\_OfflineInstaller.zip file to the "OfflineActivation" folder in the installation directory of GTA 4.
3. Run OfflineActivation.exe in the "OfflineActivation" folder.
4. Enter your Unlock Code in the field provided and click "Activate".
5. Enjoy playing GTA 4 offline!
