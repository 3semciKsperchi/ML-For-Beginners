- Chapter 4: Strain. This chapter defines strain as the relative change in length or angle of a material due to deformation. It also discusses the types and components of strain, such as normal strain, shear strain, volumetric strain, and strain rosette.
- Chapter 5: Mechanical Properties and Constitutive Relations. This chapter describes the mechanical properties of materials, such as modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, ultimate strength, ductility, toughness, and hardness. It also explains the constitutive relations that describe the relationship between stress and strain for different types of materials, such as linear elastic, nonlinear elastic, plastic, viscoelastic, and creep.
